A faction built around the white dragon [[Broadlands/Campaign 1/NPCs/Kalthas the Wingless\|Kalthas the Wingless]]. It's power steadily grow as it domains expands across the Broadlands.

A kingdom on the coast of the Broadlands who claims authority over the whole land but is only recognized in the South and West. They seek respect for their claim but must first fix their own internal disputes.

#### 🦎 the Kobolds

For lack of a better term -- or at least one for now -- the Kobolds seem to be a loose conglomerate with mysterious connections to the great red dragon and razer of [[Kehliel\|Kehliel]], [[Broadlands/Campaign 1/NPCs/Fyrenthor the Red Scourge\|Fyrenthor the Red Scourge]]. The only known connection is [[Broadlands/Campaign 1/NPCs/Cobalto the Prince of Kobolds\|Cobalto, the prince of Kobolds]].
