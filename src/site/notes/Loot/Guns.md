# Firearms/Guns
Guns come in two types for Pot campaigns, the magically powered runetech guns and black powder guns. Across all the lands of Pan, guns are rare. Black powder guns are a recent and poorly understood invention. Only a few artisans across the land can make a black powder weapon, and even less can make a half-decent one.  Similarly, runetech weapons are difficult to find, but for other reasons. Simple runetech weapons were invented by the [[Merusia\|Merusians]] during their [[Merusian Conquest\|conquest]] in the earlier modern era. They proved so dominant in the early stages of war, that the [[animalapilanimite\|animalapilanimite]] mines, the core power source of runetech, were destroyed and all weapons seized and stored.

In the Kingdom of Pot, [[The Mutt\|The Mutt]] is currently working to deregulate firearms and bring the to commoner as a way to combat the ever increasing crime in Shoe.

| Ammunition    | You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. Loading a one-handed weapon requires a free hand. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield. If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Loading       | Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Range         | A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon’s normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon’s maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can’t attack a target beyond the weapon’s long range.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| Poor-recovery | At the end of combat, the ammunition you recover is not immediately usable, you must wait until you have a significant amount of down time, a bullet mold, and proper way to recast your ammunition into the proper shape. In most cases, this means only after a long rest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

## Runetech Guns
Runetech guns operate slightly differently to normal. They only have a singular range, they don't use ammunition, and they have special rules for empowering and reloading them.
