# 🧙‍♂ Welcome to the Land of Ümm!

>And also the Isle of Pan, the Kingdom of Pot, and the city of Shoe!

The Kingdom of Pot and the greater continent of Pan is a campaign setting designed around whimsy. Its inspiration is primarily taken from Adventure Time and Studio Ghibli. This manifests in themes of regrowth and reconstruction. The major cities of Pan are built upon the ruins of prehistoric civilizations and the magic of the world is weak and untapped. Right now, in the clean year of

## Organizations

### Factions and Guilds

[[Umm/Lore/Organizations/Skydivers Guild\|Skydivers Guild]]: A group of scavengers who don heavy diving gear and miles of rope to jump of the floating city of [[Umm/Locations/Fofam\|Fofam]] and in the [[Umm/Locations/Abyssal City\|Abyssal City]] city deep in the ocean below.


### Faiths, Religions, and Philosophies

[[Mission of Merus\|Mission of Merus]]: The newest of the three core faiths, the Mission of Merus focuses on outreach, education, and innovation through magic. It is practiced mainly in the east where its founder Merus created the first spell book and shared his cantrips throughout the lands.
- [[Protoatong\|Protoatong]]: The primary denomination of the [[Mission of Merus\|Mission]] which believes in collective education, charity and outreach, and progress through innovation. Their temples are closer to libraries than churches.
- [[Gnomer\|Gnomer]]: A denomination of the [[Mission of Merus\|Mission]] that focuses on personal knowledge and enlightenment. Followers create their own books of truths and spells modeled of [[Merus\|Merus]]' own rejecting all other knowledge until they have confirmed it for themselves.
- [[Nailian Orthodox\|Nailian Orthodox]]: A denomination in the east of [[Nailia\|Nailia]] that believes [[Merus\|Merus]] began as a Nailian before heading East, and before he vanished, returned with a second and more advanced spell book which he sealed in a tomb hidden in the eastern dunes.

[[Old Hope\|Old Hope]]: The Old Hope is an all encompassing faith representing those who worships the Elders, the [[Harbinger\|Harbinger]]s, the [[Umm/Lore/Guardian\|Guardian]]s, the Gods and the Titans. Their worship is more traditional consisting of sermons, prayer, and missions. Common examples of the Old Hope include:
- [[Herd of the Horse Lord\|Herd of the Horse Lord]]: Followers of the greater cavalry conqueror, [[Umm/Character Creation/Species/Atalan Autarun\|Atalan Autarun]], who hope to carry on his bloodline and inherit he famed combat skills and legendary sorcery. 
- [[Church of Zerula\|Church of Zerula]]: The classic good guy chillers.

- [[Sanctuary of Golden Fields\|Sanctuary of Golden Fields]]: Kind farmers with well-kept hearths.
- [[Home of the Three Rings\|Home of the Three Rings]]

[[Wan-Jer\|Wan-Jer]]: The Wan-Jer are focused on nature, resourcefulness, independence and tradition.

- [[Second Sister Masrasa\|Second Sister Masrasa]]: A combination of [[Wan-Jer\|Wan-Jer]] beliefs of interconnectedness and an [[Old Hope\|Old Hope]] following of the ideals layed out by the Mother of [[Morcs\|Morcs]], the second sister.

## Peoples

Listed [[Umm/Lore/Peoples/Peoples of Umm\|here]] are brief descriptions of the peoples of [[Umm/Locations/Pan, the Greater Realm\|Pan]]. If they have a particularly interesting or adapted culture and placement, there will also be a page for them.

## Magic

Pot's magic is primarily folk. These folk spells are written down and never inherent. They are cast with their specific materials and never with a replacement spellcasting focus. They are almost always cast as rituals, but some more studious or experience citizens can cast them quickly. 

However, this doesn't make magic uncommon, it just makes it either expensive or specialized. For example, the richest people, like those living in Shoe's Platton neighborhood, have house wizards who light candles and magically clean. And the chef's who having been cooking for years have minor magic imbued in their best dishes.

## Culture
As for culture, Pot is also a boiling cauldron of sentient peoples and its oldest city, the city of Shoe exemplifies this ideal. The classic races of D&D interweave themselves with many homebrew races like [[Umm/Character Creation/Species/Weirds\|Weirds]] and [[Umm/Character Creation/Species/Wildlings\|Wildlings]] in such a way that a dancing skeleton or a fish controlling a robot wouldn't warrant a second look.

The [[Umm/Lore/Deities/Deities\|deities of Pan]] are also very different from standard D&D settings. They are separated into two major categories, Titans and Gods. Titans are like forces of nature. They effect your life even if you don't know about them. They do not demand grand action, but they do ask for action in accordance with their domain. On the other hand, Gods are like people. They are powerful and temperamental. If you provide tribute, you feel great actionable, but spite them and you will feel their wrath.

## Non-magic Tech
Pan is generally low tech, with technology only as advanced as it was around the early 19th century. Black powder and steam engines are recent and highly experimental inventions and  haven't been widely adopted because of more accessible magic. Few exception exist however, like the Iron Roadrunner, a semi-magical steam train that runs from the Dwarvish mountains of Stonton across the Nailian desert to the capital of Pan.
