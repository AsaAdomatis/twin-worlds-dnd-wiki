**Nipping Nimbus**
_1st-Level Conjuration_  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of silver dust and a drop of water)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You summon a swirling, charged icey mist in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you can see within range. The area becomes lightly obscured as the amp fog rolls in, all your enemies within it.
- The fog lingers for the spell’s duration and does not impede movement or vision beyond the obscuration.
- Each enemy that starts its turn within the fog takes 2 cold damage, which cannot be avoided or reduced and their movement speed is reduced by 10 feet until the end of their turn.
- The fog counts as magical and disperses if affected by strong winds (at the DM’s discretion).

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher:
- The radius increases by **5 feet**
- The damage increases by 2 for every slot level above 1st.
