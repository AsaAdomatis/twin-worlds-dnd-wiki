# Dust Whirl
_Transmutation Cantrip_  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** V  
**Duration:** Up to 1 minute

You command the air and earth to stir particles of dust, ash, or sand in your vicinity, creating small but dramatic effects. You can create one of the following magical effects within range:

- **Dust Flicker:** Cause a sudden **gust of swirling dust** to briefly obscure a 5-foot cube. It provides **heavily obscured** condition for 1 round and then dissipates. Useful for a momentary distraction.
- **Erosion Touch:** Instantly cause a layer of **fine dust** to form on an object no larger than 1 cubic foot. Alternatively, clean or remove existing dust from an object.
- **Dust Echo:** Shape drifting motes of dust into a faint **image**, such as a symbol, vague humanoid form, or swirl of motion, which lingers for 1 minute before collapsing.
- **Grain Whisper:** Cause the ground in a 10-foot square to **whisper** subtly with the shifting of dry earth and grit.
- **Trace the Air:** Reveal invisible movement (such as someone walking, passing, or sneaking) by momentarily causing **settled dust to rise and swirl** in their wake.
    
You can have up to three of these effects active at once, and you can dismiss them as a bonus action.
