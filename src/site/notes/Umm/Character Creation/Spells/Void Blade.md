# Void Blade
_1st-level Conjuration (Riven)_ 
**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V  
**Duration:** 1 minute  
**Classes:** Riven

You infuse a melee weapon you’re holding with planar energy, turning it into a conduit for your magic. For the duration, the weapon becomes your spellcasting focus. When you hit with a critical strike using the weapon, you can choose to teleport the target up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see.

In addition, the next time you hit a creature with this weapon before the spell ends, it takes an extra 1d8 force damage.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the bonus damage increases by 1d8 for every slot level above 1st.
