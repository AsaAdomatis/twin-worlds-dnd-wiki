# Abduction
*2nd-level Conjuration Spell*
**Casting Time:** 1 Action/1 Bonus Action
**Range:** 60ft
**Components:** V, S

A extremely bright light appears and begins pulling all loose objects and people into it. Creatures within 20 feet of a point that is outside or under an easily destructible covering and that you choose within range  must make a Strength Saving throw or be sucked into the Astral plane for 1d4 + 1 (10-30 seconds). At the end of the period, the light returns and deposits the targets from a safe distance onto that same point.
