# Enoki
## Lore
### Physical Description

Enokis appearance's vary based on the fruiting body of the fungus they grew from. They lack a neck and their bodies and limbs are extensions of the mushroom's stalk.

### Society

Enoki society revolves around the mycelium network and the collective unconsciousness within it. Enoki are the fruiting bodies that once grew from the network and have separated into the own being. However, they still retain a piece of the collective dream. When Enoki are young, they live in their homeland with elders Enoki who instill wisdom of the outside world into them. When they reach adulthood, most Enoki leave the colony to search for adventure and experience. Once they have lived a life worth living they return home to the colony and eventually to the network itself, imparting the mycelian dream with the experiences of their lives.

### Enoki Names

Since Enoki do not need to communicate verbally, they do not develop true names until they leave their colony. The names they adopt are representative of their core identity from the dream. In the minds of humanoids, these names often expressed in short phrase.

**Enoki Names:** Leaves Falling in Moonlight, Umbrella in a Storm, Ships Burning at Sea, Crows on a Roof, Warmth of the Hearth, Fresh Baked Bread.

## Mechanics

- **Ability Score Increase.** Your Wisdom score increases by 2 and your Charisma score increases by 1.
- **Creature Type.** You are a plant.
- **Size.** You are medium or small depending on your age.
- **Age.** Enoki grow quickly, reaching maturity by the age of four. However, the length of their lifespan varies greatly with the oldest elders being just shy of a thousand.
- **Rarity.** Enoki are rare in the city of Shoe, occupying about 5% of the population. However, they are very common in the shaded groves and forests around Pot.
- **Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
- **Rapport Spores.** You may as an action, extend rapport spores in a 30-foot radius. These spores can go around corners and affect only creatures with an Intelligence of 2 or higher that aren't undead, and constructs. Affected creatures can communicate telepathically with one another while they are within 30 feet of each other. The effect lasts for 1 hour.
- **Languages.** You can read, understand, and write Common. You cannot speak it. You are not, however, nonverbal; Enoki still hum, whistle, and grumble, which forms the verbal components for your spells if you cast them. If you are silenced by an effect, you can still communicate telepathically with your spores, but you cannot use spells with a Verbal component.

- **Decomposer.** You know the [Decompose](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:decompose) cantrip.
- **Piece of the Dream.** As an action, you touch one creature. If that creature is unwilling you must make an attack roll with proficiency and strength or dexterity to hit them first. For the duration of the spell, you both are incapacitated and enter a mycelian dream. While in the dream, you cannot deal damage to each other and you have advantage on charisma checks against the other creature. On the creatures turn, it may use its action to make a wisdom saving throw. On a success it exits the dream. You may end the dream yourself at any time.  If either creature take damage while in the dream, the dream ends. The DC of the Wisdom saving throw is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + you wisdom modifier. After using this trait, you can't use it again until you long or short rest.
- **Calming Presence.** When you long rest in a safe area, you and everyone affected by your rapport spores that is also resting, regains an additional hit die. They may keep up to one excess hit die they gain this way until they long rest again.
