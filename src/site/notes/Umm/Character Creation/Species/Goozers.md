### Physical Description

Goozers are humanoid in shape, but rough around the edges. They're made of a waxy or gelatinous substance the mimics the classic shape of humanoids. The color of their complexion is mostly determined by their subspecies, Ochres being yellow and green, grays being black to light gray, and translucences being, well, translucent with a tinge of a variety of colors. They size is also fairly dependent on their subrace. Grays occupy the bottom of the spectrum ranging from 1ft to

4.5ft, while translucences occupy the top, ranging from 5.5ft to 9ft on the very upper end. Ochres occupy the full range of the two. Goozers don't have true hair or facial features, but will sometimes try to mimic those of the people they around often. They do however, have eyespots in place of eyes that look like two black dots. Each of these eyespots can move freely around the body of a Goozer.

# History

Goozers are the reformed oozes from the abandoned cities and dungeons of eras passed. After many years sitting in solitude, the rare ooze developed consciousness and sought a more interesting life. Some sought exploration, others sought companionship. After encountering the vast array of humanoids that inhabit the realm, Goozers sough to take the same form.

### Society

Since Goozers are such a rarity, when they are found in the small hamlets around the outskirts of Pot, they adopt whatever society that has adopted them. However, in the bustling cities of [[Umm/Locations/Fofam\|Fofam]], [[Umm/Locations/Shoe\|Shoe]], and [[Umm/Locations/Mountmouth\|Mountmouth]], Goozers will often form small groups. They'll often live in the decrepit abandon parts of town - the areas that most remind them of their home - and search secret meeting places that can only be accessed by having Goozer traits.
