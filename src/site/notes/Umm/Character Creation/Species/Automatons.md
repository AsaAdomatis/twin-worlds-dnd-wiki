> Automatons are mechanical creatures of diverse backgrounds. However, all share in the fact that they were built by a creator.

In his effort to repay those who save his life, he builds mechanical automatons to give the most intelligent fish a shot at integrating with terrestrial life. Once in each of their lives, Fishborg will make a pilgrimage

Anytime your health drops to 0 or at will, you may resume playing as if you were a fish inside of a fish bowl with a small opening.  If you would be instantly killed, instead your fish bowl shatters. Resume play as if you were a fish out of water. Use the Quipper stat block minus Blood Frenzy as reference for a simple fish.
