# Wildlings
> Wildlings are animals with humanoid builds. Instead of being a vast array of unique races, all wildlings have the same origin, lycanthropy. A wildling, or more properly, a Veranthrope is a lycanthrope that has ascended beyond the separation of beast and humanoid, reconciling the two. Modern wildlings are almost always descendants of the original enlightened few. They live in small hamlets across Pot with other Wildlings of like appearance. Some traces of the original cultures of Wildlings are present in the hamlets. Many Mouslings still live life like Halflings and Lionins like the nomadic humans tribes from the South.

- **Ability Score Increase.** When determining your character’s ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. You can't raise any of your scores above 20. Choose scores that make sense with what animal your lineage is based off of.
- **Creature Type.** You are both Humanoid and Beast.
- **Size.** Your size is Medium or Small.
- **Age.** Your life span is about the range of most humanoids, reaching adulthood around age 25 and living around 120 years.
- **Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
- **Languages.** You can speak, read, and write in Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character.

## Customizing a Wildling

If you'd like to build your own Wildling you can consult the following guide to help determine abilities. Create a Wildling using the initial racial traits (the ones listed after the quote) and a total additional ability weight of 3-5.

### Weight: 1

- Darkvision (60ft).
- +5 Walking Speed
- +15 Swim Speed
- Climb speed equal to your movement speed
- **Skillful.** You have a skill proficiency of your choice.
- **Brave.** You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.
- Darkvision (120ft) and Sunlight Sensitivity
- **Nimble.** You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours.
- **Savage Attacks.** When you score a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, you can roll one of the weapon's damage dice one additional time and add it to the extra damage of the critical hit.
- **Powerful Build.** You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.
- **Useful Appendage.** You have an additional appendage you can make use of like a weak arm. It has a reach of 5 feet, and it can lift a number of pounds equal to five times your Strength score. You can use it to do the following simple tasks: lift, drop, hold, push, or pull an object or a creature; open or close a door or a container; grapple someone; or make an unarmed strike. Your DM might allow other simple tasks to be added to that list of options. It can't wield weapons or shields or do anything that requires manual precision, such as using tools or magic items or performing the somatic components of a spell.
- **Keen Smell.** Thanks to your sensitive nose or sensory organs, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception), Wisdom (Survival), and Intelligence (Investigation) checks that involve smell.
- **Daunting Roar.** As a bonus action, you can let out an especially menacing roar. Creatures of your choice within 10 feet of you that can hear you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you until the end of your next turn. The DC of the save equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
- **Hold Breath.** You can hold your breath for up to 10 times your Constitution modifier minutes at a time.

### Weight: 2

- + 15 Burrow Speed
- **Naturally Stealthy.** You can attempt to hide even when you are obscured only by a creature that is at least one size larger than you.
- **Keen Hearing.** Thanks to your sensitive ears or sensory organs, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception), Wisdom (Survival), and Intelligence (Investigation) checks that involve hearing.
- **Hop.** As a bonus action, you can jump a number of feet equal to five times your proficiency bonus, without provoking opportunity attacks. You can use this trait only if your speed is greater than 0. You can use it a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
- **Water Breathing.** You can breathe underwater.

### Weight: Variant

- Unarmored AC: Your durable flesh gives you a resistance to attacks. Consult the following chart to determine an AC.

|        |                              |
| ------ | ---------------------------- |
| Weight | AC                           |
| 1      | 12                           |
| 3      | 14                           |
| 5      | 16                           |
| 1      | 11 + DEX Mod                 |
| 2      | 12 + DEX Mod                 |
| 1      | 16, but you can't wear armor |
| 2      | 17, but you can't wear armor |

- **Natural Weapon.** Your anatomy gives you the ability to attack with part of your body without using a weapon. You are proficient with unarmed attacks and your attacks deal (1: 1d4, 2:1d6) bludgeoning/slashing/piercing damage
- **Winged Flight.** You have wings that you can use to fly. Consult this [chart](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pbkd-cffrjGgzJotgl6hozYhoe-hQdRgGxjYZV74dHI/edit) multiplying weights by 2 to calculate the weight of your flight.
