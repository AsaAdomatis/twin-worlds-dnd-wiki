# Barbarian: Path of the True Elemental
#subclass #barbarian #weird 

Barbarians who find the Path of the True Elemental realize their inner elemental potential, accessing it to gain abilities beyond the normal capacity of Weirds.

## Restriction: Weirds Only
Only [[Umm/Character Creation/Species/Weirds\|Weirds]] can follow the Path of the True Elemental. A true elemental access Weirds base elemental form and expands on it.

Your DM can lift this restriction to better suit the campaign. The restriction exists for the Kingdom of Pot. It might not apply to your DM's setting or your DM's version of this setting.

## Level 3: Elemental Expertise
When you reach 3rd level, you gain proficiency in Nature and Arcana and learn either [Druidcraft](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:druidcraft) or [Prestidigitation](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:prestidigitation).

## Level 3: True Form
Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can access your true, primal elemental form. You can transform your humanoid body into a swirling mass of elements based on your Weird's elemental origin. When you enter your rage, you can transform into your true, primal elemental form. Until the rage ends, you get the following:
- You gain immunity to the following status conditions: exhaustion, grappling, paralyzed, poisoned, restrained, and prone. 
- You lose the need for air, food, drink, or sleep.
- You gain an additional use of your inherent magic trait (from the [[Umm/Character Creation/Species/Weirds\|Weird]] species). (If you do not use the additional use and your rage ends, it does not carry beyond rage. However, if you use the trait once before rage, then none during, your one usage per long rest is restored)
- You may occupy the same space as your elemental origin, and are fully invisible when doing so.
- Your weapons are enchanted with your magical essence. When you make an attack, you may consider that attack magical and change its damage to the type as specified by your elemental origin (If no origin is listed, you may choose one of the base elements making your combination):

| **Origin Element** | **Damage Type** |
| ------------------ | --------------- |
| Fire               | Fire            |
| Water              | Bludgeoning     |
| Earth              | Bludgeoning     |
| Air                | Thunder         |
| Ice                | Cold            |
| Smoke              | Poison          |
| Mud                | Poison          |


## Level 6: Core Sight
Beginning at 6th level, you gain the ability to perceive the core elemental components that make up the material and element planes. You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet that can be used to see objects (including creatures) from the elemental and material planes. During your rage, this range increases to 30 feet.


## Level 10: Elemental Absorption
Beginning at 10th level, you primal elemental form becomes so powerful it cannot be harmed by its core elements. If you have one elemental origin, you gain immunity to the damage type as listed below, and when you would be dealt damage by that type, you instead heal that damage. If you have a combination elemental origin, you gain immunity to both damage types of your elemental origin. The immunities are listed below:

| **Origin Element** | **Immunity Type**             |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Fire               | Fire                          |
| Water              | Cold, Bludgeoning<sup>1</sup> |
| Earth              | Bludgeoning<sup>2</sup>       |
| Air                | Thunder, Other<sup>3</sup>    |
- <sup>1</sup> -> Bludgeoning as dealt by a source of water
- <sup>2</sup> -> Bludgeoning damage as dealt by as a source from the earth like stone, metal, dirt, or mud. (This doesn't include organic objects like wood or a beast's claw)
- <sup>3</sup> -> Any damage dealt that would be dealt by a high winds

You gain these immunities and absorptions while you are raging. 

## Level 14: One with your Origin
Beginning at 14th level, you gain the ability to navigate the elements as if they were your own. As long as your are touching an area/object of 1 of your elemental origins, as a bonus action, you may teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that is continuously connected to the area/object your are touching.

If you have only one elemental origin, you gain 1d6 temporary hit points.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

For this feature, some specification on the area/object of elemental origin is required:
- Fire -> Just fire
- Water -> Water or ice
- Earth -> Stone, metal or dirt
- Air -> A cloud of any kind 

## Level 20: Master of the Material
Starting at 20th level, you become the embodiment of all elemental energy. You can alter your elemental origin, changing you appearance and your primal elemental form. When you finish a long rest, you may change your elemental origin provided in the [[Umm/Character Creation/Species/Weirds\|Weird]] species. You may reselect qualities for each of your species traits when you do this.
