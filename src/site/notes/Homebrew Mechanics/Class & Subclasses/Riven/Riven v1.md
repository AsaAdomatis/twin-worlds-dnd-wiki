As a Riven, you gain the following class features when you reach the specified Riven levels. These features are listed in the Riven Features table.

### Level 1: Spellcasting

You have learned to cast spells through your connection to the astral sea and outer planes. See Chapter 7 for the rules on Spellcasting. The Information below details how you use those rules with Paladin spells, which appear in the [[Homebrew Mechanics/Class & Subclasses/Riven/Riven Spell List v1\|Riven Spell List]] later in the class's description.

**Spell Slots.** The Riven Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.

**Prepared Spells of Level 1+.** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Riven spells [[Umm/Character Creation/Spells/Void Blade\|Void Blade]] and [[Umm/Character Creation/Spells/Gravity Shift\|Gravity Shift]] are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Riven levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Riven Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Riven spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 5 Riven, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.

If another Riven feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Paladin spells for you.

**Changing Your Prepared Spells.** Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one spell on your list with another Riven spell for which you have spell slots.

**Spellcasting Ability.** Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Paladin spells.

**Spellcasting Focus.** You can use [Navigator's Tools](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/124-navigators-tools) as a Spellcasting Focus for your Riven spells.

### Level 1: Obscuration

You have the power to temporality split you and your allies across different planes, causing them to become split across the ethereal and across the planes. This ability to split across the ethereal is represented by your Obscurity dice, which is a d8.

**Using Obscurity.** You can use your Obscurity dice in two ways:
- **Attack Rolls.** When a creature succeeds on an attack roll on you or a creature adjacent to you, you can take a Reaction to expend one use of your Astral Blurring; roll your Obscurity die, and subtract the result from the creature's attack potentially turning the success into a failure. If the result doesn't change the success to a failure, a use isn't expended.
- **Saving Throws.** When you or a creature adjacent to you fails a saving throw, you can take a Reaction to expend one use of your Astral Blurring; roll your Obscurity die, and add the result to the saving throw potentially turning the failure into a success. If the result doesn't change the failure to a success.

**Number of Uses.** You can expend an Obscurity die a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Short or Long Rest.

**At Higher Levels.** Your Obscurity die changes when you reach certain Riven levels, as shown in the Obscurity Die column of the Riven Features table. The die becomes a d8 at level 5, a d10 at level 10, and a d12 at level 15.

### Level 1: Weapon Mastery

Your training with weapons allows you to use the mastery properties of two kinds of weapons of your choice with which you have proficiency, such as short swords and hand crossbows. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change the kinds of weapons you chose.

### Level 2: Summon Rifts

You have the power to open small rifts to other planes and use them to your advantage. 

**Summoning Rifts.** As a bonus action, you can summon a rift within 15 feet of you tethered to an ally or on a point. If you tether the rift to an ally, it occupies their same space and follows them as they move. The rift last 1 minute, until you dismiss it as a free action, or until you get more than 120 feet more away from the rift.

**Travelling with Rifts.** Additionally, as a bonus action, you can teleport to an unoccupied space adjacent to one of your summoned rifts and dismiss it.

**Known Rifts.** When you summon a rift, you choose which rift type to create, but you cannot have more than rift of the same type summoned at a time. You start knowing two rifts:
- **Pulsar.** The rift produces a pushing radius. A creature must make a Strength saving throw or be pushed 10 feet away from the rift when it enters the rift's radius for the first time on its turn or when it starts its turn there. Additionally, the terrain within the radius is difficult terrain.
- **Vortex.** The rift produces a pulling radius. A creature must make a Strength saving throw or be pulled 10 feet towards the rift when it enters the rift's radius for the first time on its turn or when it starts its turn there. Additionally, the terrain within the radius is difficult terrain.

**Rift Radius.** The radius of effect of your rifts is 10 feet. Your radius for these effects increases when you reach certain Riven levels, as shown in the Rift Radius column of the Riven Features table.

**Saving Throws.** If a Summoned Rift effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals the spell save DC from this class's Spellcasting Feature.

**Number of Uses.** You can use this class's Summon Rift twice. You regain one of its expended uses when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest. You gain additional uses when you reach certain Riven levels, as shown in the Rift Number column of the Riven Features table.

### Level 2: Ethereal Evasion

You can take the Dodge action as a bonus action and when you do you gain advantage on Dexterity saving throws.

Additionally, when you're subjected to an effect that allows you to make a dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw.

### Level 3: Riven Subclass

You gain a Riven Subclass of your choice. The (subclasses name) subclasses are detailed after this class's description. A Subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Riven levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Riven level or lower.

##### Riven Subclasses

| Name                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------- |
| [[Homebrew Mechanics/Class & Subclasses/Riven/Void Riven v1\|Tether of the Empty Sea]] (Unfinished) |
| [[Homebrew Mechanics/Class & Subclasses/Riven/Elemental Riven v1\|Tether of the Inner Planes]]      |
| [[Homebrew Mechanics/Class & Subclasses/Riven/TP Riven v1\|Tether of the Traveler]]                 |

### Level 3: Glimpse the Cosmos

You can attune your mind to the space between planes glimpsing the unknowable.

As an action, you can expend an Obscurity die to add the result to your Wisdom or Intelligence based skill/ability checks, Passive Wisdom and Intelligence checks and Initiative Rolls for the next 1 minute.

### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the [Ability Score Improvement feat](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/feat:ability-score-improvement) or another [feat of your choice](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/feat:all) for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Riven levels 8, 12, and 16.

### Level 10: Reactive Rifts

As a reaction, you can use your Obscurity die on allies within 5 feet of your Rifts. When you do, you teleport to that Rift and dismiss it.

### Level 14: Disperse

When you are about to take damage, you can use your reaction to disperse your corporeal form, casting your spirit into the Astral Sea, the void between the planes. When you do so, you vanish, and your body ceases to exist. You are considered dead for all game purposes, but your spirit endures.

While dispersed in this way:

- You cannot be targeted by any effect, and your consciousness drifts through the Astral Sea.
- If a spell that restores you to life but not undeath (such as _raise dead_, _resurrection_, or _true resurrection_) is cast with the sole purpose of reviving you, it requires no material components, and your corporeal form is not needed.
- If you are not returned to life through magic, your body begins to reform on the plane where you last stood. After 7 days, you fully reconstitute in a location on that plane you are familiar with and choose upon dispersing. You return to life at full hit points, with no penalties associated with dying.

Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again for another 2 weeks after reforming.

### Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an [Epic Boon feat](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/feat:all) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify.
