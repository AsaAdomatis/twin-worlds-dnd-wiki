# Riven: Tether of the Inner Planes

A paragraph describing the lore and theme of the subclass.

### Level 3: Elemental Invocation

You choose an inner plane from which you draw your power. Based on that plane, the damage type of certain features from this subclass changes.

| Inner Plane    | Damage Type         | Additional Effect                                                                          |
| -------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Plane of Fire  | Fire                | A flammable object hit ignites if it isn’t being worn or carried.                          |
| Plane of Water | Cold                | Any ignited object hit is extinguished.                                                    |
| Plane of Earth | Magical Bludgeoning | Shatters and smashes small objects hit by it and near it.                                  |
| Plane of Air   | Magical Slashing    | Disperses gas or vapor, extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames hit. |

Additionally, once per turn, when you deal damage, add 1d6 damage to that damage based on your Invocation Type.

### Level 3: Inner Planar Rift

You learn the following rift:
- **Elements.** This rift produces a damaging elemental radius. A creature takes damage equal to your Riven level of your elemental invocation type when it enters the rift's radius for the first time on its turn or when it starts its turn there. Additionally, the terrain within the radius is difficult terrain.

### Level 7: Elemental Armor

When you expend an Obscurity die on yourself or an ally, you may also protect them with an Elemental Armor. The armor has has the following characteristics:
- The armor has its own hit points equal to twice your Riven level. 
	- Whenever the wearer would takes damage, the armor takes the damage instead. 
	- Whenever the armor would be reduced to 0 hit points, excess damage is not dealt to the wearer.
- The wearer has resistance to your elemental invocation damage type. (Magical or non-magical for air and earth)

Only one creature can have your Elemental Armor at a time and once your use this feature you can't use it again till your finish a long rest.

### Level 11: Intraplanar Connection

You may choose an additional inner plane to represent use as your elemental invocation. Whenever you would use a feature that use that invocation, you choose the type there.

Additionally, your additional damage provided via your Elemental Invocation die increases to 2d6

Also, when you summon a rift using a different Elemental Invocation damage type, it doesn't count as the same type of rift for your Summoning Rift feature.

### Level 15: Improved Armor

As a bonus action, you can apply your Elemental Armor to a creature within adjacent to you or within the radius of one of your rifts without expending a Obscurity die.

Additionally, whenever another creature wearing your armor deals damage you can add your extra Elemental Invocation die to their damage. If you do, you cannot add it to your damage on your next turn.

Once you use this feature you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. However, when you expend a Obscurity die to activate your Elemental armor feature, it doesn't expend a use of this feature.

### Level 18: Intraplanar Mastery
