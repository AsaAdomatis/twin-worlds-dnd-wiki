# Riven: Tether of the Traveler

A paragraph describing the lore and theme of the subclass.

### Level 3: Far Traveler

You and your allies can use your rifts as portals for quick convenient travelling.
- When you or an ally teleports through one of your rifts, it isn't dismissed.
- Your allies take an Action to teleport through an adjacent rift to another rift or you.
- If an ally with a rift tether to them teleports to another rift, the tethered rift becomes untethered and stays where it was before the ally teleported.

### Level 3: Mundane Rift

You learn the following rift:
- **Mundane.** This rift has no additional mechanical effect.

Additionally, you can summon a Mundane or Gateway Rift (mentioned later) rift once per short rest or long rest without expending a use of your Summon Rifts.

### Level 7: Gateway Rift

You learn the following rift:
- **Gateway Rift.** Allies within the radius of this rift can us a bonus action to teleport through the rift to anywhere within the radius of another rift. When another creature starts their turn within the rift's radius or enters the rift's radius for the first time, they make a Constitution Saving Throw. If they fail, you may teleport them to any location within the radius of another rift. Additionally, the terrain within the radius is difficult terrain.

### Level 7: Pulsing Transport

When you teleport using one of your rifts, you can send out a pulse wave. Each creature within 15 feet of your must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, they take 2d6 force damage and are knocked prone. On a success, they only take half damage and aren't knocked prone. This damage increases at higher levels. At level 11 to 3d6; level 15, 4d6; and level 18 5d6.

Once you use this feature you can't use it again until you finish a long or short rest.

### Level 11: Teleport

Once per long rest you can cast [Teleport](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/spell:teleport) or [Plane Shift](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/spell:plane-shift) without requiring a spell slot. 

### Level 15: Extended Range

Your rifts can get 300 feet away from you instead of 120 feet before they fizzle out and are dismissed.

Additionally, as a bonus action, you can move one of your rifts that isn't following an ally in any direction up to your move speed.

### Level 18: Astral Projection

Once per long rest you can cast [Astral Projection](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/spell:astral-projection) or [Gate](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/spell:gate) without requiring a spell slot.
