As a Empath, you gain the following class features when you reach the specified Empath levels. These features are listed in the Empath Features table.

#### Level 1: Empath's Presence

*Beginning at 1st level*, *your insight into emotions gives you true governance over them.* 

Your access to this well of emotional energy and social presence is represented by a number of **Mote Points**. You have a number of **Mote Points**, as show in the Mote Points column of the Empath Feature table (part B).

You can expend these points to enhance or fuel certain Empath features. You start knowing one such features: **Quip**.

When you spend a Mote Dice, it is unavailable until you finish a long rest, which during, you experience a fit of emotions or meditate on your emotions, refueling your intrinsic power. You must spend at least 30 minutes in a fit of emotions or meditating to fully restore your mote dice. A fit of emotions can occur as a nightmare or a dream during your sleep.

When an Emotional Effect ends on a creature, it knows it has been effected by your speech and actions, but doesn't know it was effected by magic.

**Quip:** As a bonus action you may spend 1 **Mote Point** to choose one creature within 15 feet of you that can see and hear you. The target must make a **Charisma saving throw**. On a failed save, the target is affected by an **Emotional Effect** of your choice. A creature may choose to automatically fail this saving throw.
- **Quip Saving Throw DC** =  8 + your proficiency bonus + your charisma


##### Improved Presence

**Additional Emotions:** At 1st level, you know 2 emotions from the [[Homebrew Mechanics/Class & Subclasses/Empath/Empath Emotions List v2\|Empath Emotion List]]. You learn an additional emotion as shown in the Known Emotion column of the Empath Feature table (part B).
- Additionally, whenever you learn an emotion, you can choose one of the emotions you know and replace it with another emotion that you could learn at that level.

**Emotional Specialization:** When you would learn a new emotion - except at 1st level - you can instead specialize in another emotion you already know. When you do this, that emotions magical effect can be trigger on a result totaling 15 or more rather than 20 or more.

**Additional Concentrations:** At 1st level you can only maintain concentration on 1 emotional effect at a time. You gain the ability to maintain additional concentrations on emotional effects at higher levels as shown in the Maintainable Effects column of the Empath Feature table (part B).

##### Limitations

Emotional effects only effect creatures that have emotions. Below are a list of common indicators that a creature is not capable of emotions or complex though:
- Intelligence 3 or less.
- Immunity to being both frightened and charmed.
- Immunity to Psychic damage.

#### Level 1: Calming Charm

Your calming calming can sooth and inspire others. You have a pool of calming power that replenishes when you finish a Long Rest. With that pool, you can confer a number of temporary hit points equal to 5 times your Empath level.

As a Bonus Action, choose a creature within 15 feet of you that can see and hear you and has emotions (which could be yourself). You draw power from your pool of calming to give a number of temporary Hit Points to that creature, up to your Empath level and no more than maximum amount remaining in the pool.

You can also expend 5 Hit Points from the pool of calming power to do either of the following:
- Remove the [Charmed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition) condition and/or [Frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition) condition from the creature; those points don’t also restore Hit Points to the creature.
- Make the target indifferent about creatures of your choice that it is hostile toward. This indifference ends if the target is attacked or harmed by a spell or if it witnesses any of its friends being harmed.
- A creature with 0 hit points regains 1 hit point, becomes stable, and suffers 1 level of exhaustion.

#### Level 1: Weapon Mastery

Your training with weapons allows you to use the mastery properties of two kinds of weapons of your choice with which you have proficiency, such as Hand Crossbows and Nets.

Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change the kinds of weapons you chose. For example, you could switch to using the mastery properties of Rapiers and Whips.


#### Level 2: Fighting Style

*Starting at 2nd level, your expertise in combat manifests itself in a fighting style.*

You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose 1 of the options from the [[Homebrew Mechanics/Class & Subclasses/Empath/Empath Fighting Style List v2\|Empath Fighting Style List]] You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

#### Level 2: Insightful Learner

_You can temporarily learn from the talents of others with remarkable precision._

After you observe a creature using a skill, tool, weapon, or armor, you can choose to gain proficiency in that skill or tool until your next long rest. If the skill or tool is one you're already proficient with, you instead gain **Expertise** (double your proficiency bonus) with it. You gain these skills by either:
- Spending 30 minutes observing a creature using that skill, tool, weapon, or armor.
- Witnessing a creature successfully use that skill, tool, weapon, or armor and successfully making a DC 15 Insight (Wisdom) ability check as a **reaction**.

You can temporary learn a number of proficiencies or expertises at once equal to your **proficiency bonus**, and these choices last until you finish a long rest. If you exceed this limit, you must choose one of your current adaptations to forget.

#### Level 3: Empath subclass

You gain a Empath subclass of your choice. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Empath levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Monk level or lower.

**Aspects:**
- the General - combat leader, apply effects with attacks
	- manipulative technique: on damaging enemies
- the Mentor - guide, apply effects with help action
	- manipulative technique: one person at a distance strong
- the Leech - lurker in the shadows, apply effects secretly
	- directly on one person, but they don't know
- the Siren - center of attention, applies effects to people that can see them
	- manipulative technique: large weak area of effect
	- fighting styles: distraction and mariner

#### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the [Ability Score Improvement feat](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/feat:ability-score-improvement) or another [feat of your choice](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/feat:all) for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Empath levels 8, 12, and 16.

#### Level 5: Extra Attack

*Starting at 5th level*, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.


#### Level 5: Specialized Study

*Starting at 5th level, through careful watch of other, stranger beings, the subtle emotional magic you wield spikes in power and can now be accessed as distinct mind magic. This magic allows you to dominated others with less mental capabilities.*

Choose a creature type from the following list when you gain this feature: beast, undead, construct, ooze. When you would inflict any emotional effect on a creature of that type that is incapable of emotions, it instead falls under you control. For as long as their under your emotional effect, you dominate them mentally and they must obey your commands to the best of their ability. Each creature you dominate in this way counts as a separate, unique **Emotional Effect** you are maintaining.
- When you would inflict an emotional effect on a creature of that type that is capable of emotions, they loose immunity to the frightened and charmed condition and immunities to psychic damage become resistances.


#### Level 9: Unreadable Veil

Creatures have **disadvantage on Insight checks** made to read your intentions or emotional state.

In addition, when a creature attempts to **read your mind or detect your thoughts** using magic (such as detect thoughts, zone of truth, or similar effects), it must succeed on a **Wisdom saving throw** against your **Mote Save DC**. On a failure, the spell or effect provides only vague, conflicting, or misleading emotional impressions, and the creature gains no meaningful insight.

#### Level 10: Stoic Empowerment

When a creature within the range of your **Manipulative Technique: Projection** or **any number of creatures** within the range of your **Manipulative Technique: Outburst** is required to make a **saving throw against a mental or emotional effect** you can use your **reaction** to empower their will.
- Mental effects include effects like being **charmed**, **frightened**, or affected by a spell like vicious mockery.

To do so, expend any number of **Mote Die**. Each affected creature adds the **result of the Mote Dice** to their saving throw.

You can choose to use this feature **after the roll is made but before the result is determined**.

#### Level 13: Multiplexities

You can maintain concentration on an additional **Emotion Effect**. You can maintain concentration on additional **Emotional Effect** when you reach 17th and then another when your reach 20th level.

When you lose concentration on one emotional effect, you lose concentration on all effects.

When you apply a new Emotional Effect and do not have enough capacity to concentrate on it, you end a different Emotional Effect of your choice.

#### Level 14: Observational Insight

If you spend **1 hour observing and studying a creature** by watching their expressions, behavior, and emotional responses, you can attune yourself to their emotional rhythms. For the next **24 hours**, as long as the creature is within your sight and within range of your **Manipulative Technique: Projection**, you can sense their **surface thoughts** (what is currently on their mind) without requiring concentration or magical detection.

This awareness does not reveal deeper motives or hidden truths, but it allows you to subtly interpret their current focus, intent, or emotional state. Creatures affected by mind blank or similar magic are immune to this effect.

#### Level 15: Improved Manipulative Techniques

The capabilities of your manipulative techniques increase:
- The range of your **Projection** technique increases to 120 foot.
- The range of your **Outburst** technique increases to a 15 foot radius.
- Whenever an object you're touching contacts another creature, you can use your **reaction** rather than your bonus action to active your **Imbuement** technique

#### Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an [Epic Boon feat](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/feat:all) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify.
