# Empath: Aspect of the Warheart

Warhearts are powerful leaders in combat who use their expertise of emotions to lead themselves and their allies passionately into battle and striking great fear into their enemies.

## Level 3: Fighting Style

*Starting at 3rd level, your expertise in combat manifests itself in a fighting style.*

You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

- **Insightful Fighting (Homebrew).** When you attack with a weapon, you can use your Mote Ability Modifier, instead of Dexterity or Strength, for the attack and damage rolls.
- **Archery (PHB).** You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.
- **Blind Fighting (TCE).** You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.
- **Dueling (PHB).** When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.
- **Superior Technique (TCE).** You learn one [maneuver](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/fighter:battle-master:maneuvers) of your choice from among those available to the [Battle Master](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/fighter:battle-master) archetype. If a maneuver you use requires your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects, the saving throw DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice.)
    - You gain one superiority die, which is a d6 (this die is added to any superiority dice you have from another source). This die is used to fuel your maneuvers. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.
- **Thrown Weapon Fighting (TCE).** You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon.
    - In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.
- **Two-Weapon Fighting (PHB).** When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.
- **Unarmed Fighting (TCE).** Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier on a hit. If you aren't wielding any weapons or a shield when you make the attack roll, the d6 becomes a d8.
    - At the start of each of your turns, you can deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage to one creature grappled by you.
- **Close Quarters Shooter (UA).** When making a ranged attack while you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature, you do not have disadvantage on the attack roll. Your ranged attacks ignore half cover and three-quarters cover against targets within 30 feet of you. You have a +1 bonus to attack rolls on ranged attacks.
- **Distraction ([Homebrew](https://www.enworld.org/threads/homebrew-fighting-styles-thread.483800/)).** When you attack with your weapon your mighty bellow and antics tend attract attention. When you take the Attack action on your turn, as a bonus action, you may subject creatures hostile to you within 10ft to make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. If they fail, they focus their attention on you, granting them disadvantage on their attacks and perception checks if it is not against you.
- **Inspiration ([Homebrew](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/Mr_PmXYwKakp)).** While you are conscious, an ally's attack against a creature within 5 feet of you scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.
- **Inspiring Fighter ([Homebrew](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/Mr_PmXYwKakp)).** When you take the Help action to aid an ally in attacking, the ally gains temporary hit points equal to half your level which disappear at the end of your next turn.
- **Restful Fighting ([Homebrew](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/Mr_PmXYwKakp)).** When you finish a short or long rest, you and each creature you rest with can grant advantage to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes of its choice before it finishes a short or long rest.
	- The time it takes to finish a short or long rest is halved for you and one creature of your choice that you rest with.

## Level 3: Commander's Surge

_Starting at 3rd level, your emotional reflexes surge to life the moment danger strikes._

Once per long rest, when you roll initiative, you regain a number of expended **Mote Dice**. The total number of sides across all regained dice is less than or equal to twice your Empath level. (For example, a d6 Mote Die counts as 6 sides.)

You may divide this total across as many dice as you wish, provided their combined sides do not exceed the limit.

**Example:** At 6th level, you can recover up to 12 sides' worth of Mote Dice. You could regain two d6s (6+6), or three d4s (4+4+4), or one d6 and one d4 (6+4).

## Level 7: Extra Attack

*Starting at 7th level*, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

Once per turn, when you make an attack, you may instead replace that attack with a use of a **Manipulative Technique.**

## Level 11: Leader's Preparation

*Starting at 11th level, you are always prepared to lead your allies into combat.*

When you roll initiative, you may immediately expend any number of your **Mote Dice**. For each die spent this way, you may trigger a chosen **emotional effect** based on the results of your **Mote Dice** for you and your allies and/or all enemies with 10 who didn't succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (against your **Mote Save DC**).

## Level 18: Relentless Passion

*Starting at 18th level, your passion as a commander and a warrior is unstoppable.*

When you are reduced to 0 hit points and are not killed outright, you can choose to expend any number of **Mote Dice** and restore that many hit points, preventing your death/unconsciousness. Once you use this ability, you can't use this feature again **until you finish a long rest**.
