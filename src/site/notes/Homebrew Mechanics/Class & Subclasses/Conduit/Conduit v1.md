As a Conduit, you gain the following class features when you reach the specified Conduit levels. These features are listed in the Conduit Features table.

### Level 1: Magical Conduit

You can channel the magical energy of the world around you directly through your body. This energy is represented by Channeling Points. Your Conduit level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Channeling Points column of the Conduit Features Table (Part B).

You can expend these points to enhance or fuel certain Conduit features. You start knowing three such features: **Conduit Form**, **Absorption** and **Empowerment**.

When you expend a Channeling Point, it is unavailable until you finish a Long Rest, at the end of which you regain all your expended points.

Some features that use Channeling Points require your target to make a saving throw or an attack roll.
- **Channeling save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
- **Channeling attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

Some features say you may expend a number of **Channeling Points** to use them. For those features, you can expend a number of **Channeling Points** up to your proficiency bonus.

#### Conduit Form

As a **bonus action**, you can spend a **Channeling Point** to attempt to enter your **Conduit Form** by making a **DC 8 Constitution saving throw**. On a success, you enter the form until the end of your next turn and can attempt to maintain it each turn thereafter. 
- If you run out of **Channeling Points**, you **Conduit Form** immediately ends.
- You can use your **bonus action** to end your form.
- While in your form, when you would spend Channeling Points to enhance or fuel another Conduit feature, you may instead spend 1 less point (This can reduce the number of points you spend to 0). Once you use this feature, you can't use it until the beginning of your next turn.
- Your form can last at most a minute.

While you are in your **Conduit Form**, at the **end of each of your turns** (except the one you used to enter the form), you must repeat the **DC 8 Constitution saving throw** to maintain control.
- **On a failure**, the form ends immediately and you release a destabilize pulse of energy.
	- Each creature within 5 feet of you, including yourself, takes 1d4 force damage.. 
	- Each creature other than your self within 5 feet of you must succeed on a **DC Strength saving throw** or be knocked 5 feet backwards.

#### Absorption

When you take damage, you can use your **reaction** and expend any number of **Channeling Points** to reduce that damage by 3 for each point expended.

#### Empowerment

When you deal damage with a weapon attack, you may expend a number of **Channeling Points** to deal an additional 1d4 force damage for each point expended this way.

### Level 1: Magic Sight

As a **bonus action**, an **action**, or an **attack**, you hone your senses to the inherent magical rhythms of the world. You gain [blindsight](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/The%20Environment) within 30 feet, can see behind total cover within 30 feet, and can sense if any creature or object within that range bears magic until the beginning of your next turn.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your **intelligence modifier**, and you regain all uses when you finish a **long rest**.

### Level 1: Weapon Mastery

Your training with weapons allows you to use the mastery properties of two kinds of weapons of your choice with which you have proficiency, such as longswords and longbows.

Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change the kinds of weapons you chose. For example, you could switch to using the mastery properties of short swords and short bows.

### Level 2: Conduit Weapon

You specialize in a weapon type, gaining additional capabilities with it and the ability to channel your conduit energy into while in your **Conduit Form**. Choose from the [[Homebrew Mechanics/Class & Subclasses/Conduit/Conduit Fighting Style List v1\|Conduit Weapon List]].

### Level 2: Channeling Techniques

You choose a Channeling technique from the [[Homebrew Mechanics/Class & Subclasses/Conduit/Conduit Channeling Technique List v1\|Channeling Technique List]]. You choose an additional techniques at higher levels as show in 

You gain one Technique of your choice, such as **Barrage**. Techniques are described in the  [[Homebrew Mechanics/Class & Subclasses/Conduit/Conduit Channeling Technique List v1\|Conduit Channeling Technique List]].

**Prerequisites.** If an technique has a prerequisite, you must meet it to learn that technique. For example, if an technique requires you to be a level 5+ Conduit, you can select the invocation once you reach Conduit level 5.

**Replacing and Gaining Techniques.** Whenever you gain a Conduit level, you can replace one of your invocations with another one for which you qualify. You can’t replace a technique if it’s a prerequisite for another technique that you have.

When you gain certain Conduit levels, you gain more techniques of your choice, as shown in the Techniques column of the Conduit Features table.

You can’t pick the same technique more than once unless its description says otherwise.

### Level 3: Conduit Subclass

You gain a Conduit subclass of your choice. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Conduit levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of  your Conduit level or lower.

| Name                                        |
| ------------------------------------------- |
| [[Homebrew Mechanics/Class & Subclasses/Conduit/Shadow Conduit\|Leyline of Shadows]] (IP) |
| [[Homebrew Mechanics/Class & Subclasses/Conduit/Sage Conduit\|Leyline of Knowledge]] (V1) |
| [[Homebrew Mechanics/Class & Subclasses/Conduit/Fiend Conduit\|Leyline of Royalty]] (V11) |

### Level 3: Maintainable Form

As long as your not in combat or a highly stressful situation, you can maintain your **Conduit Form** more easily. While not in either of these situations, your **Conduit Form** can last up to an hour, and you make the Constitution saving throw for the form every 10 minutes rather than every turn.

### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the [Ability Score Improvement feat](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/feat:ability-score-improvement) or another [feat of your choice](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/feat:all) for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Conduit levels 8, 12, and 16.

### Level 5: Extra Attack

You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Level 6: Overdrive: 1st Degree

 When you would enter your **Conduit Form**  or during it, you can choose to enter a heightened state called Overdrive. When you do so, select a degree.

- While in Overdrive and attempting to enter it, the DC for your Constitution saving throws to enter and maintain Conduit Form increases by 5 for each degree (DC 13 at degree 1, DC 18 at degree 2, etc.).
- The cost of spending channeling points for Conduit features decreases by an additional 1 for each Overdrive degree (Degree 1: -2 points once until your next turn; Degree 3: -4 points once until your next turn.)
- When your Overdrive ends, either voluntarily or from failing a save, you suffer a level of **exhaustion equal to the Overdrive degree** chosen.

You can only use **Conduit Form: Overdrive** once per long rest. When you fail the save to enter your **Conduit Form: Overdrive** it does not count as using this feature.

You can enter **Conduit Form: Overdrive** with a degree as high as a number as shown in the Degree column of the Conduit Features table.

### Level 9: Improved Magic Sight

The range of your Magic Sight increases by 30 feet and last for 1 minute (instead of 1 round) when used.

### Level 13: Iron Will

Whenever you make a Constitution saving throw, you treat any result lower than 10 as if you had rolled a 10.

### Level 18: Final Heartbeats

When you or an ally within 30 feet of you is reduced to 0 hit points or fewer, you can immediately enter an Overdrive form with a degree of your choice which lasts at most 1 minute. While in this form, you are immune to all damage and effects of exhaustion.
- If you entered this form because your hit points were reduced to 0 or fewer, you drop to 1 hit point instead.

Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again for another month.

### Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an [Epic Boon feat](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/feat:all) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify.
