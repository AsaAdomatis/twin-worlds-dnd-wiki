# Archivist: Favor of the Goldbinder

### Level 3: Collectors Spells

You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the table below. Each of these spells counts as an archivist spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of archivist spells you know.

| Archivist Level | Spells                                                                                                   |

### Level 3: Flip of Fortune

As a bonus action, you may enchant a gold coin in your hand with magical fortune telling powers for one minute. Then, the holder of it may flip it as a bonus action. On heads, the next attack, ability check, or saving throw they make is made with advantage. On tails, it is made with disadvantage instead. Additionally:
- The holder of the coin immediately know its enchanted and knows something is to be gained or loss when its flipped.
- The holder may dismiss the disadvantage provided by the flip by using an action.

You can enchant a number of coins equal to your proficiency bonus and once you enchant a coin you can't again until you finish a long rest.

### Level 7: Coin Shot

You gain the ability to fire coins from your collection with surprising force. As an action, you can make a ranged spell attack against a creature within 120 feet of you. On a hit, the target takes force damage based on the quality of coin. Hit or miss, the coin bounces off a surface hitting another target within 60 feet of the original. You must make a separate attack roll for the other target.


| Coin     | Damage                             |
| -------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Copper   | 1d6  + your intelligence modifier  |
| Silver   | 1d8  + your intelligence modifier  |
| Gold     | 1d10  + your intelligence modifier |
| Platinum | 1d12 + your intelligence modifier  |

**At Higher Levels.** The coins bounces additional times hitting more targets with each bounce. At 11th level, it bounces two times passed the original target, and three times at 17th level. You must make a separate attack roll for the other targets.

### Level 11: Force the Hand

As a reaction, when you would make an attack, ability check, or saving throw, you may instead flip a coin, succeeding the check on heads, failing it on a tails.

Once you've used this feature, you can't use it till you've finished a short or long rest.

### Level 14: Improved Enchantment

You improve the quality of the enchantment you can place on coins. When another creature touches the coin, you may have them make a Wisdom saving throw against your Spell Save DC. If they fail, for as long as they hold the coin, they are charmed by you, they are compelled to continue to hold the coin, they must use their bonus action to flip the coin, and a heads does not result in advantage for them.

### Level 18: True Luck

You can use your Force the Hand feature any number of times without being limited to one use per short or long rest.
